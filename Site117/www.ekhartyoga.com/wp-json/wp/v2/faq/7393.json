No yoga teacher knows your body as well as you do, so if anything doesn&#8217;t feel right, you are free to take breaks and\/or skip poses or sequences that are not suitable for you.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&nbsp;recommend that you use these online classes in addition to attending classes or workshops with an experienced yoga teacher who can observe you and give you personal guidance where required.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We do not offer medical advice. If you have any doubts please consult your medical practitioner before starting yoga or if you are coming back to it after illness or injury. This is particularly important for, but not limited to, the following conditions: if you are pregnant, nursing, taking medication, have low or high blood pressure, or have any existing medical condition or injuries. If you feel dizzy, light-headed, faint, or if you experience any other discomfort, stop&nbsp;immediately and take a resting pose. Consult a medical professional if your symptoms do not pass.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most&nbsp;classes on this website will include warming up and cooling down sections, however, shorter classes such as&nbsp;pose tutorials may not. Please take responsibility for your own body and include extra warm up and cool down stretches where appropriate to avoid injuries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The information provided on our website is provided for educational and background purposes only. Using the website and the information provided is at your own risk.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-account-and-payments\">Account and payments <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-free-trial-and-membership-options\">Free trial and membership options<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We offer a free two-week trial for new members. We ask for your payment details when you register because we may&nbsp;take a small test payment of 1 cent for some payment methods. This is refunded to you. At the end of your trial, your membership will automatically convert to a monthly recurring subscription unless you cancel within your trial period. To view the end date of your free trial go to your account settings and view subscription. Please see our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ekhartyoga.com\/about\/faq\/account-and-payment\">FAQ<\/a> for more details.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A monthly or annual subscription with EkhartYoga gives you access to all our classes and programs. See our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ekhartyoga.com\/pricing\">Pricing page<\/a> for details of what\u2019s included.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-payment-methods\">Payment methods<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can pay online with a credit card from Visa, Mastercard and American Express. Or pay using PayPal, SofortBanking, iDeal, Vpay or Bancontact. When subscribing our Payment Service Provider will display the payment options available to you depending on your location and membership history.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All our credit card transactions are secure and processed by Buckaroo B.V. and Adyen N.V.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some payment methods, the service provider may charge you certain fees, such as foreign transaction fees. Please check with your payment method service provider for details.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can view and change your payment methods in your Account Settings once you are a member and we may also update your payment methods using information provided by our payment service providers, for example if your card has expired.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-recurring-payments\">Recurring payments<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your monthly subscription is automatically renewed each month so you will be charged at the end of every subscription period until you decide to cancel your account.&nbsp;Your membership fee will be charged to your payment method on the date indicated on your subscription tab in your Account settings. In some cases your payment date may change, for example if your payment&nbsp;has not successfully gone through or if your paid membership began on a day not contained in a given month.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Annual subscriptions are automatically recurring.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For most payment methods you will be automatically charged around 24 hours before your new month begins. If you are paying through iDeal your payments will be taken around 72 hours before due to longer bank processing times.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your recurring payment is unsuccessful our payment providers will re-try your payment method. If after 2 weeks we still have not successfully charged your payment method, your access to the site will be revoked.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-cancellations\">Cancellations<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can cancel your subscription at any time via your account settings. Please note that recurring payments are taken a minimum of 24 hours before the end of your subscription period. You will continue to have access to EkhartYoga&#8217;s classes until the end of your monthly or annual subscription period.&nbsp;Please see our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ekhartyoga.com\/about\/faq\/account-and-payment\/how-do-i-cancel-my-subscription\">payment FAQ<\/a> for full&nbsp;details.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-refunds\">Refunds<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We do not offer refunds for partial membership periods or&nbsp;if you have not used the service.&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-changes-to-the-subscription-price\">Changes to the subscription price<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We may change the price of our subscriptions. However, we will notify you in advance and any price changes or changes to your subscription plans will only apply to subsequent billing cycles. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-terms-of-use\">Terms of Use <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-comments-on-classes-programs-and-playlists\">Comments on classes, programs and playlists<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We welcome and encourage your comments and questions under classes, programs and Playlists.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We monitor comments to ensure that any questions do not go unanswered and to gather feedback to help us improve the website.
